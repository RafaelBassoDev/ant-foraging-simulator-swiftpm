                            In this project I decided to create an Ant Foraging Simulator, a project where some ants will wander around searching for food to bring back to their colony. As they walk, pheromones will be left on their path to help other ants to find the best route to some food or to the colony.

                            I've been wanting to do this project for a while now, because since the beginning it amazed me and I always thought that there were a lot of things to learn in order to create a simulation.
                            
                            Adding the fact that Ants are really intricate beings and have some amazing behaviors in the nature, I decided to face the challenge and use this simulator as my main idea to apply for the Scholarship.

                            After clicking the \"â–º\" button, you will be redirected to the simulation screen.
                            
                            There you can change some settings of the simulation by clicking the button on the top right corner of the screen, and changing the values using the sliders.
                            
                            IMPORTANT: Food can be added on the screen by simply clicking on the desired location!
                            
                            It is as simple as that, feel free to read the cards beside or to start the simulation!!
